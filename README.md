# EdgeTimer-Extension
 
Really simple extension I whipped up because I love the timed aspect of the mini and wanted to bring it to Connections.
This is my first time playing around with js and am aware its not perfect.

TO DO:
- reposition the timer to be in line with the hint button.
- If you are viewing your results after completing the days Conns, dont display the timer
- Store the timer value in a cookie based off the date so you can reload the page and keep your time.
- Append the time to the end result share results clipboard info
- Add Icon for extension
